# Repository for mulit-target prediction datasets
This is a repository for datasets that fall under the umbrella of multi-target prediction. More specifically, the 
repository contains datasets from the following problem settings:

* Multi-label classification
* Multivariate (Multi-target) regression
* Hierarchical Multi-label classification
* Dyadic prediction
* Matrix Completion

## Multi-label classification
The following datasets were collected from the [Extreme Classification Repository](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html)

### 1) Bibtex

General information about the datasets:

| Dataset | Instance Dim. | Label Dim. | Training Set size | Test Set size | 
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| `Bibtex` | 1836 | 159 | 4880 | 2515 | 
| `Delicious` | 500 | 983 | 12920 | 3185 | 

The dataset was first introduced by [Katakis et al.](http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/katakis_ecmlpkdd08_challenge.pdf) 
and is concerned with the automated tag recommendation problem.

### 2) Delicious
The dataset was first introduced by [Tsoumakas et al.](http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/tsoumakas-mmd08.pdf)
and is also concerned with automated tag suggestion problem. The dataset was extracted from the del.icio.us social 
bookmarking site on the 1st of April 2007. 


The features for the instances are in the form of Bag-of-word representations.
